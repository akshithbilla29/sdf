        As a poet and writer:-
————————————

Influenced by the Malidasa Telangana movement, Mahender has so far authored seven books of poetry and edited four more books under his editorship.

In the context of the Telangana movement, he published and unveiled his first book 'Poruganam' in the year 2011 to sensitize the movement. In the same year, he protested the self-sacrifice of the students in the movement and wrote a booklet called 'Balidanala Maruddam' to inspire them and tried to present it to the students in various meetings.

In 2012, he wrote a book of poetry titled 'Pidikili' (Telangana Poetry) and gave life to the movement by turning the events happening during the movement into poetry from time to time.

In the year 2014, as part of an effort to instill self-confidence among the disabled by taking inspiration from the Telangana movement, he compiled a poetry collection titled 'Kaalani Gelutu' (Poetry on Special Talents) under his editorship with the poetry of 100 poets from the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state. This collection earned Mahender the reputation of being the first book of poetry on the disabled in Telugu literature.
